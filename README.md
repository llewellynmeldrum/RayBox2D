# RayBox2D

Part of a rube goldberg machine for a group task in an ENG subject.



# Libraries Used 
*For both libraries, they are linked through static libraries compiled for ARM64. They definitely only work on ARM64, and probably only work on macos as well.* (I wanted to learn a bit more about the compilation process)

## Raylib 
Avaliable [here](https://github.com/sponsors/raysan5). Super well documented, extremely good user experience. By far the best graphics library in C ive used so far. 

## Box2D
Avalaible [here](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d). Much more sparse documentation than raylib. The docs on the website are slightly out of date too, for example the descriptions of joints and their functions/members are out of date. You can piece it together by looking at the samples however. But theyre in C++. :(

# Progress
### earlier prototype
